# Registration Feature Testing Guide

## Registration Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All necessary components for the registration functionality have been successfully implemented:

- ✅ Registration page component with form validation
- ✅ Authentication service for API communication
- ✅ Redux state management and actions
- ✅ Protected routes and navigation
- ✅ TypeScript type definitions

## Testing the Complete Authentication Flow

### 1. Registration Process
1. Launch the application
2. Click the "Sign Up" button in the header
3. Fill out all fields in the registration form:
   - Username (min 3 characters)
   - First name
   - Last name
   - Email (must be valid format)
   - Password (min 8 characters, with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character)
   - Confirm password (must match password)
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. You should see a success message and be redirected to the login page

### 2. Login Process
1. On the login page, enter the email and password you just registered with
2. Click "Sign In"
3. You should be logged in and redirected to the home page
4. The header should now show your avatar instead of login/signup buttons

### 3. Protected Route Access
1. Navigate to the Profile page
2. Verify you can access it while logged in
3. Log out using the menu in the top right
4. Try to access the Profile page again
5. You should be redirected to the login page

## Notes for Developers

- All required files are already implemented and functioning correctly
- The implementation currently uses mock data (will be replaced with real API calls)
- Registration data is not persisted between sessions (will be stored in a database in production)
- To add real API integration, update the auth service with your API endpoints

## Next Development Steps

1. Connect to a real backend API
2. Add email verification process
3. Implement password reset functionality
4. Add social login options (Google, etc.)
