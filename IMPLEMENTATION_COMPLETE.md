# Registration Implementation Complete

The registration functionality has been successfully implemented with all necessary components:

## Files Created/Modified:

1. **Registration Component:**
   - Created `src/pages/Registration/Registration.tsx` with form validation using Formik and Yup
   - Implemented password visibility toggle
   - Added proper loading states and error handling

2. **Authentication Types:**
   - Added `AuthResponse` interface to `src/types/auth.ts`
   - Ensured proper type definitions for registration data

3. **Authentication Service:**
   - Created `src/services/authService.ts` for API communication
   - Implemented token management and error handling

4. **Redux Integration:**
   - Added registration functionality to `src/features/auth/authSlice.ts`
   - Implemented async thunks for registration process

5. **Routing:**
   - Updated `App.tsx` to include the Registration route
   - Added "Sign Up" button to the Header component

## Testing the Registration Flow:

1. Click the "Sign Up" button in the header
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Submit the form (currently uses mock data)
4. You will be redirected to the login page after successful registration
5. Log in with your new credentials

## Next Steps:

1. Connect to a real API for authentication
2. Implement email verification
3. Add password reset functionality
4. Enhance form validation with more sophisticated rules

Note: The required files `src/utils/hooks.ts` and `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` were already implemented in the project and are working correctly.
